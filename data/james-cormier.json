Which is why you're reading this now. He lives in Massachusetts with his wife, his son, and the requisite two cats that every writer of fantasy and science fiction is presented with upon the publication of their first novel.</p>",

Most of those few who survived humanity\u2019s destruction spend their short lives in a violent struggle for survival. But some light still flickers in the darkness: the Blessed of Bountiful live in seclusion, relying on walls both physical and spiritual to protect them from the Desolation that their world has become.

As attacks on the community grow harsher and more frequent, however, even the steadfast Blessed are forced to start preparing for the worst.</p><p>With her home\u2019s very existence threatened, seventeen year old Ever Oaks, a Saint with the power to heal, is forced to make a difficult choice, one that may come to define her people\u2019s future\u2026</p>",
