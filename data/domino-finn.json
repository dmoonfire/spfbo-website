	"summary": "<p>For Dante Butcher, Los Angeles ghost hunting isn't a business, it's a pastime. Going to clubs, knocking back a few drinks, even taking the occasional punch are all in a night's work. But cool confidence doesn't prepare Dante for what begins in a piss-soaked bathroom. The Dead Side opens up a whole new world to him, and for the first time, it's the ghosts that are hunting Dante</p>",
	"about": "<p>Domino Finn is an entertainment industry veteran, a contributor to award-winning video games, and a Contemporary Fantasy author. Whether writing gritty police procedurals with werewolves or chronicling the exploits of an irreverent partier who sees ghosts, his stories are notable for treating weighty issues with a supernatural veneer. If Domino could shout one message to the world, it would be that it's okay to take fantasy seriously.</p>",
