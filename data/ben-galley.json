His father's last will and testament forces him west across the Iron Ocean, to the very brink of the Endless Land and all civilisation. They call it Wyoming.</p><p>This is a story of murder and family.</p><p>In the dusty frontier town of Fell Falls, there is no silverware, no servants, no plush velvet nor towering spires. Only dust, danger, and the railway. Tonmerion has only one friend to help him escape the torturous heat and unravel his father\u2019s murder. A faerie named Rhin. A twelve-inch tall outcast of his own kind.</p><p>This is a story of blood and magick.</p><p>But there are darker things at work in Fell Falls, and not just the railwraiths or the savages. Secrets lurk in Tonmerion's bloodline. Secrets that will redefine this young Hark.</p><p>This is a story of the edge of the world.</p>",
